# Project Control Panel - Requirements
#
# This application uses only Python standard library modules.
# No external dependencies are required to run the main application.

# Minimum Python version: 3.7+ (due to asyncio and dataclasses usage)
# Recommended Python version: 3.8+
#
# Standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - pathlib, os (file system operations)
# - subprocess (running external commands)
# - asyncio (async/await operations for background tasks)
