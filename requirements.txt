# Runtime Dependencies
requests>=2.25.0                # HTTP requests for validation service API

# Note: The main application uses Python standard library modules where possible.
# Minimum Python version: 3.7+ (due to asyncio and dataclasses usage)
# Recommended Python version: 3.8+
#
# Standard library modules used:
# - tkinter (GUI framework)
# - pathlib, os (file system operations)
# - subprocess (running external commands)
# - asyncio (async/await operations for background tasks)
# - dataclasses (data structures)
# - typing (type hints)
# - time, shutil, platform (utilities)
# - concurrent.futures (thread pool executor for CPU-bound tasks)
